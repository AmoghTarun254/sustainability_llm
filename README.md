# What are sustainability frameworks?
Sustainability frameworks are structured approaches and sets of guidelines designed to help organizations, governments, and individuals manage and measure their environmental, social, and economic impacts. These frameworks provide a systematic way to integrate sustainability into decision-making processes and operations, ensuring that activities support long-term ecological balance, social equity, and economic viability.Here are some key aspects and examples of sustainability frameworks:

**UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**: A set of 17 global goals established by the United Nations to address various sustainability challenges by 2030. The goals cover areas such as poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, and peace and justice.

**Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)**: Provides comprehensive sustainability reporting standards that help organizations measure and communicate their economic, environmental, and social impacts. The GRI standards are widely used for sustainability reporting and disclosure.

**ISO 14001**: An international standard for environmental management systems. It provides a framework for organizations to manage their environmental responsibilities systematically and improve their environmental performance.
